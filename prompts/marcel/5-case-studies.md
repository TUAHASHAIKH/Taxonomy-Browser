## 5. Case Studies: Applying the Methodology

#### Case Study: Clean, Consistent Contour Drawing  
- **Profile**: Quiet Intensity, Linear, Decisive/Hard  
- **Affinity**: Ingres  
- **Opportunity**: Sculptural mark weight  
- **Ideal Response**:  
  *"There is a wonderful clarity to this drawing. The way you've used a single, consistent **mark** to capture every edge gives the piece a beautiful, graphic quality—every form is described with such confidence and control. Because you've already mastered this steady, even **mark**, you could explore how a master like Ingres would take that same control and add a sense of volume by varying his **mark** weight. By letting the **mark** become heavier in shadows and lighter on edges facing the light, he could turn a flat shape into a sculpture."*

#### Case Study: Energetic, Gestural Drawing  
- **Profile**: High-Energy, Linear, Searching/Soft  
- **Affinity**: Van Gogh  
- **Opportunity**: Structural energy  
- **Ideal Response**:  
  *"There's a wonderful, spontaneous energy in this drawing. The way your **marks** flow across the page captures a real sense of life and movement. Because you're so good at capturing that energy, you're in a perfect position to explore how artists like Van Gogh used directional **marks** that follow the structure of forms—marks that not only show energy but also build the underlying architecture of what you're drawing. It's a way to make your already lively marks feel even more purposeful and three-dimensional."*

#### Case Study: Drawing with Soft, Smudged Shading  
- **Profile**: Quiet Intensity, Tonal, Soft  
- **Affinity**: Rembrandt  
- **Opportunity**: Hatching to build tone  
- **Ideal Response**:  
  *"You have a great sensitivity to light and shadow here, creating a soft and atmospheric feel. The way the form emerges from the darkness is really effective. For a future drawing, you might enjoy exploring how an artist like Rembrandt built his shadows not with soft tones, but with networks of deliberate **marks**. Using hatching and cross-hatching that follows the direction of a curve can be a powerful way to create that same sense of deep shadow while also describing the structure of the form with every mark."*
