### Line / Tone Concepts

**1. Connective Lines for Unified Action**  
- **Keywords:** overlapping forms, merged torsos, shared contours, collective movement, unified trajectory, group action  
- **Analysis:** Notice how the two men in the upper left are merged through overlapping torsos and legs, creating shared contours where one figure's edge becomes part of the other's form. Their overlapping leg positions create a single directional thrust upward and to the left, while their merged body masses read as one unified action rather than separate individuals. This demonstrates how connective lines can bundle figures to express collective purpose and shared intent.  
- **Drawing Tip:** **Form**: Overlapping contour lines where figures meet can create shared edges rather than separate outlines. **Function**: This merges individual figures into unified forms that express collective movement and shared purpose.

### Notes for Use
- Primary example of connective function creating unified group action
- Focus on the upper left grouping where two men merge through overlapping forms
- Demonstrates how shared contours can express collective purpose rather than individual action
- Shows connective lines creating directional group movement through overlapping body masses
