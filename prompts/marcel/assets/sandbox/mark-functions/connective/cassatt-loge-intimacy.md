### Line / Tone Concepts

**1. Connective Lines for Creating Intimacy**  
- **Keywords:** connective lines, intimacy, circular motion, bundling, eye movement, relationships, unity  
- **Analysis:** Notice how the fan's curved edge rises from the seated woman's torso, arcs across the composition, and flows toward her companion's shoulder, creating a continuous circular path that your eye follows around and around. This arcing motion visually binds the two figures within a single, intimate unit. The fan simultaneously defines one woman's form AND connects to the other woman's upper body, creating dual-function lines that bundle the figures together rather than separating them.  
- **Drawing Tip:** **Form**: Flowing, connecting lines that guide the viewer's eye in a continuous path around subjects can show relationships. **Function**: This creates visual intimacy by enclosing figures in a shared, unified space.

### Notes for Use
- Primary example of connective function creating emotional relationships between people
- Focus on the specific circular eye movement created by the fan's arc
- Demonstrates how lines can serve dual functions (form definition + connection)
