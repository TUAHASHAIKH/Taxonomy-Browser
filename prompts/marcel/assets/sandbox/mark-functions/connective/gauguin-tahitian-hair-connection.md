### Line / Tone Concepts

**1. Connective Lines for Dynamic Eye Movement**  
- **Keywords:** hair connection, eye guidance, fluid movement, directional flow, visual pathway, dynamic composition  
- **Analysis:** Notice how the hair outline of the upper woman flows downward on the left side and seamlessly connects with the hairline of the profile woman below. This creates a continuous flowing line that guides your eye in a dynamic, fluid movement through the composition. Each face has a distinct identity - looking in different directions as if they are different people thinking about different things - yet the connecting hair forms create a visual pathway that moves your eye fluidly between them, establishing directional flow rather than static grouping.  
- **Drawing Tip:** **Form**: Connecting elements like hair or clothing can create fluid pathways that guide the viewer's eye dynamically through compositions. **Function**: This establishes directional flow between multiple figures or studies rather than static grouping.

### Notes for Use
- Primary example of connective function creating directional eye movement
- Focus on the specific hair connection on the left side between upper and profile figures
- Demonstrates dynamic fluid pathways that guide viewer's eye through composition
- Shows distinct identities (different people looking in different directions) connected by visual flow
