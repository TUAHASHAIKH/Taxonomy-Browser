### Line / Tone Concepts

**1. Connective Lines Through Doubling Forms**  
- **Keywords:** kimono flow, doubling shapes, water-like forms, mirrored contours, fabric connection, similar rhythms  
- **Analysis:** Notice how the kimono shapes of both women in the bottom right flow downward with nearly identical contours, creating a doubling effect that mimics the movement of water. The fabric forms mirror each other's curves and rhythms, establishing visual connection through similarity rather than direct contact. This doubling creates a sense of harmony and relationship between the figures through shared formal language, where one woman's kimono shape echoes and reinforces the other's.  
- **Drawing Tip:** **Form**: Similar or mirrored shapes in clothing, hair, or drapery can connect multiple figures through visual echoing. **Function**: This creates harmony through repeated forms and rhythms that establish relationships between separate elements.
