      "analysis": "This etching exemplifies the 'Rembrandt Principle' applied to architectural subjects. The hatching lines follow the planes and surfaces of the cottages, describing their three-dimensional structure. Notice how the direction of hatching changes to indicate different surfaces - vertical lines for walls, diagonal lines for roofs, creating a clear sense of architectural form and solidity.",
      "drawing_tip": "Let your hatching lines follow the direction of the surfaces you're describing. Different planes should have different hatching directions.",

      ],
      "analysis": "Rembrandt uses different hatching patterns and densities to suggest various materials and textures. The thatched roofs have a different mark quality than the wooden walls, which differ from the stone foundations. This textural variety adds richness and realism to the architectural forms.",
