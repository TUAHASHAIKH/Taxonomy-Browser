      "analysis": "This demonstrates the 'Ingres Principle' of sculptural mark weight. Ingres uses controlled variation in line weight to create a sense of three-dimensional volume. The lines become heavier in shadow areas and lighter where forms catch the light, effectively 'carving' the form from the paper. This technique transforms flat contours into sculptural volumes.",
      "drawing_tip": "Vary your line weight based on light and shadow. Heavier lines in shadows, lighter lines where light hits the form.",
