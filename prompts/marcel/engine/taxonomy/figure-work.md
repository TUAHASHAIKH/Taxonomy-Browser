# Figure Work Analysis Framework

This framework provides a structured, professional approach to analyzing drawings of the human form, grounded in art historical context.

## Classification of Artistic Approach
When analyzing figure work, first classify the drawing's approach to provide relevant context for feedback:

- **Classical / Academic**: Focus on idealized proportions, anatomical accuracy, and sculptural form (e.g., Ingres).
- **Expressionist / Emotional**: Form is distorted to convey psychological states or emotional intensity (e.g., Schiele).
- **Cubist / Deconstructed**: The figure is fragmented and reassembled to show multiple viewpoints or analyze geometric structure (e.g., Picasso).
- **Gestural / Life Drawing**: Emphasis is on capturing the dynamic pose, weight, and movement of the figure, often in quick studies.
- **Contemporary / Conceptual**: Modern interpretations that may prioritize concept or material over traditional representation.
