# Drawing Mark Taxonomy: Mark Features

This document outlines the physical, observable properties of a mark.

## Part I: Mark Features

- **Mark Weight & Pressure**: The perceived heaviness or lightness of a mark, influenced by tool pressure.
- **Tonal Technique**: The method used to build value (e.g., hatching, cross-hatching, stippling, soft blending).
- **Edge Quality**: The character of a mark's boundary (e.g., sharp, soft, lost-and-found).
- **Speed & Rhythm**: The inferred velocity and cadence of mark-making (e.g., quick and gestural vs. slow and deliberate).
