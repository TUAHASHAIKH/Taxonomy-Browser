### Line / Tone Concepts

**1. Dot Density Modeling for Atmospheric Form**  
- **Keywords:** stipple engraving, dot density variation, tonal gradation, atmospheric modeling, form building, surface differentiation, printmaking precision, 18th century technique  

- **Analysis:** Watson demonstrates masterful stipple engraving technique where individual dots accumulate to build sophisticated tonal gradations and three-dimensional form. Notice how she varies the concentration of stipple dots to create smooth transitions from deep shadows to highlights - dense clusters of dots build the darkest areas in Garrick's face and clothing, while progressively sparse dot placement creates middle tones and atmospheric effects. The background shows her skill in using lighter, more scattered dots for spatial recession, pushing distant elements away from the foreground figure. Her dots follow the contours of three-dimensional form, particularly visible in the modeling of Garrick's face where stipple marks curve around cheeks, forehead, and jaw to build volume through accumulated tonal weight. Different materials are distinguished through stipple pattern variations - soft fabric textures contrast with crisp linear elements, demonstrating how stippling combines with other engraving techniques for complete material definition.  

- **Drawing Tip:**
**Form**: Use systematic dot placement with varying density to build tone - dense dots for shadows, sparse dots for highlights and atmospheric effects.
**Function**: This methodical approach creates smooth, continuous gradations that rival painted surfaces, particularly effective for portrait work and subtle atmospheric modeling.
