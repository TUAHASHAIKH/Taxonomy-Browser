### Tone / Blending Concepts

**1. Stumping for Smooth Tonal Gradation**  
- **Keywords:** stumping, blending technique, pressure variation, tonal passages, velvety blacks, seamless gradation, paper texture integration, pigment manipulation

- **Analysis:** Seurat demonstrates masterful stumping technique in conté crayon on Michallet paper. The work is "drawn entirely without line in tonal passages of velvety black" - achieved through systematic stumping that transforms granular conté crayon into smooth, continuous tones. Seurat uses varying pressure on the crayon combined with stumping tools to create seamless gradations from deep saturated darks to luminous mid-tones. The stumping technique eliminates harsh boundaries by physically moving and blending the pigment particles. The technique integrates with the Michallet paper's texture to produce characteristic "velvety blacks" and smooth transitions through controlled pigment manipulation.

- **Drawing Tip:** **Form**: Use stumping with varied crayon pressure - heavy pressure deposits more pigment for rich darks, light pressure for luminous mid-tones. Work the stump (a tightly rolled paper tool with pointed tip for blending) in circular or linear motions to move pigment. **Function**: Stumping eliminates linear boundaries to create seamless tonal transitions and unified value passages. **Materials**: Requires soft drawing tools (conté crayon, charcoal, soft graphite) and textured paper (like Michallet paper) - the combination allows pigment to be moved and blended effectively. Hard leads on smooth paper cannot achieve the moveable pigment quality essential for stumping.

### Notes for Use
- Primary example of stumping technique in academic drawing tradition
- Focus on how stumping creates smooth tonal transitions and form modeling
- Demonstrates integration of paper texture with blended tones
- Shows strategic use of stumping vs. direct mark-making for different effects
- **Critical Tool Requirements**: Soft drawing medium + textured paper essential for technique success
