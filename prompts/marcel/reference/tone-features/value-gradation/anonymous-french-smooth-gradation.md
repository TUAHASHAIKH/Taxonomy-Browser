### Tone / Value Gradation Concepts

**1. Smooth Gradation for Portrait Modeling**  
- **Keywords:** smooth gradation, wash technique, continuous tonal flow, seamless blending, subtle value shifts, brush control, portrait technique, graphite foundation, imperceptible transitions  

- **Analysis:** This anonymous French portrait demonstrates smooth gradation through masterful wash technique over graphite foundation. The brush and wash approach creates imperceptible tonal transitions where values flow seamlessly across forms, building convincing volume and sculptural quality. The combination of black and gray wash with white heightening allows for continuous value control that follows actual light source behavior rather than formulaic rendering. 

**Beginner Tips**: See full planes and volumes rather than just working edge-to-center; start with darkest darks and work lighter, or work both directions; avoid photography defaults where front equals light and back equals dark - instead observe how actual light sources illuminate forms.  

- **Drawing Tip:**
**Form**: Use wash technique over graphite foundation for continuous tonal transitions - build forms through gradual value shifts rather than distinct steps.
**Function**: Smooth gradation creates refined portrait modeling ideal for subjects requiring subtle tonal control and seamless form definition.

**Materials**: This technique works best with brush and wash over graphite, allowing for seamless value transitions and refined tonal effects.
