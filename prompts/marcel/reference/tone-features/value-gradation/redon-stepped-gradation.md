### Tone / Value Gradation Concepts

**1. Stepped Gradation for Dramatic Symbolic Narrative**  
- **Keywords:** stepped gradation, four-value system, systematic tonal control, high contrast placement, darkest dark next to lightest light, focal emphasis, visual dominance, extreme value adjacency, strategic contrast, symbolic narrative, charcoal wash technique, value hierarchy  

- **Analysis:** Redon's "Pegasus and Bellerophon" demonstrates systematic four-to-five step gradation for dramatic impact. The composition reveals distinct value steps: (1) preserved paper white (top left); (2) light middle tone from wash technique (wing, top right); (3) darker middle tone (horse's body, woman); (4) rich darks (prominent wing). This stepped approach creates clear tonal hierarchy and dramatic contrast essential for symbolic narrative. Additionally, Redon employs strategic high contrast placement - notice how the darkest dark of the wing sits directly adjacent to the lightest light of the paper white on the left, creating maximum contrast that draws the eye immediately to focal areas. This combination of systematic value steps with strategic extreme value adjacency creates both overall dramatic structure and specific focal emphasis.  

- **Drawing Tip:**
**Form**: Use systematic four-to-five step gradation - preserve paper white, establish light and dark middle tones, anchor with rich darks. For additional focal emphasis, place darkest darks adjacent to lightest lights.
**Function**: Stepped gradation creates dramatic tonal hierarchy essential for symbolic narrative; strategic high contrast placement draws the eye to specific focal areas.

**Materials**: This technique works best with charcoal and wash on toned paper, allowing for both additive (charcoal) and subtractive (erasure) mark-making to achieve precise value control.

### Notes for Use
- Primary example of stepped gradation technique for dramatic tonal control
- Focus on systematic 4-5 value approach for clear visual hierarchy
- Demonstrates how stepped values support symbolic narrative content
- Shows relationship between technical control and expressive content
- **Critical Tool Requirements**: Charcoal + wash + toned paper essential for additive/subtractive value control
