### Tone / Value Gradation Concepts

**1. Smooth Gradation for Refined Portrait Modeling**  
- **Keywords:** smooth gradation, imperceptible transitions, continuous tonal flow, refined modeling, portrait technique, subtle value shifts, seamless blending, atmospheric quality, delicate rendering, crayon technique  

- **Analysis:** Isabey's "Lady of the Court of Napoléon I" demonstrates masterful smooth gradation through imperceptible tonal transitions that create refined portrait modeling. The black crayon and white paint combination allows for continuous value flow across forms, with brown wash adding atmospheric depth. Unlike stepped gradation's distinct value breaks, smooth gradation creates seamless transitions where one tone flows into the next without visible boundaries. This technique excels in portrait work where subtle modeling of flesh, fabric, and atmospheric effects requires delicate value control. The smooth approach builds form through gradual tonal shifts that follow the natural play of light across surfaces, creating the refined, polished quality essential to court portraiture.  

- **Drawing Tip:**
**Form**: Use continuous tonal transitions with gradual value shifts - build forms through subtle modeling rather than distinct value steps.
**Function**: Smooth gradation creates refined, atmospheric quality ideal for portrait work and subjects requiring delicate tonal control.

**Materials**: This technique works best with soft drawing media (crayon, charcoal) combined with blending tools and wash techniques for seamless transitions.
