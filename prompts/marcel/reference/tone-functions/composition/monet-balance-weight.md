### Tone / Composition Concepts

**1. Visual Balance Through Tonal Weight Distribution**  
- **Keywords:** tonal balance, compositional weight, visual equilibrium, asymmetrical balance, tonal counterpoint, spatial organization, dynamic tension, structural harmony

- **Analysis:** Monet's "Cliffs and Sea, Sainte-Adresse" demonstrates masterful compositional balance through strategic distribution of tonal weights. Notice how the darker, more visually "heavy" cliff formations on the left side of the composition are counterbalanced by the expansive, lighter sea and sky areas on the right. This creates a dynamic asymmetrical balance that feels stable despite the uneven distribution of physical elements. The darker tones carry more visual weight, allowing a smaller area of dark values to balance a larger area of lighter values. This tonal counterpoint creates a sense of equilibrium that guides the viewer's eye through the composition while maintaining visual harmony. The careful placement of middle tones throughout the composition serves as transitional elements that connect these contrasting areas, further enhancing the sense of balance.

- **Drawing Tip:**
**Form**: Use strategic distribution of tonal weights to create visual balance—darker, more saturated areas carry more visual weight than lighter areas of equal size.
**Function**: This creates compositional equilibrium and visual harmony even with asymmetrical arrangements of elements.

**Materials**: This technique works effectively with any medium that allows for controlled tonal variation, from graphite to wash to oil paint.

### Notes for Use
- Primary example of visual balance through strategic tonal weight distribution
- Focus on how darker tones counterbalance larger areas of lighter values
- Demonstrates how asymmetrical arrangements can achieve visual equilibrium
- Shows relationship between tonal weight and compositional harmony
- **Critical Tool Requirements**: Media allowing controlled tonal variation essential for effective balance
