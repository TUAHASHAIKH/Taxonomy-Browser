## Function
Atmospheric Depth (Tone Function)

## Method Summary
- Near forms read darkest and most distinct.
- Successive mist layers lighten and soften toward the distance.
- Values compress with depth; contrast and edge acuity diminish.
- Foreground silhouette anchors space; far planes dissolve into haze.

## Why it works
Layered value recession (dark → light, sharp → soft) creates convincing aerial perspective without relying on line detail.
