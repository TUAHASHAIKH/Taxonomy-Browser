### Tone / Spatial Definition Concepts

**1. Atmospheric Perspective Through Value Control**  
- **Keywords:** spatial depth, atmospheric perspective, value gradation, architectural space, receding planes, tonal control, linear perspective, spatial hierarchy, depth cues

- **Analysis:** Canaletto demonstrates masterful spatial definition through systematic value control in this capriccio drawing. Notice how he creates convincing depth through a carefully orchestrated progression of values - foreground elements are rendered with darker, more saturated tones and precise detail, while middle-ground structures shift to lighter values with slightly less definition. The background elements fade into the lightest values with minimal detail, creating a natural atmospheric perspective that enhances the linear perspective of the architectural forms. The arches crossing the street create distinct spatial planes that guide the eye deeper into the composition. This systematic value progression establishes a clear spatial hierarchy that allows the viewer to intuitively understand the three-dimensional relationships between elements despite the two-dimensional medium.

- **Drawing Tip:**
**Form**: Use systematic value progression from dark, detailed foreground to lighter, less detailed background to create spatial depth.
**Function**: This creates convincing atmospheric perspective that enhances architectural space and guides the viewer's eye through distinct spatial planes.

**Materials**: This technique works effectively with pen and wash, allowing for both precise linear elements and broader tonal areas that establish spatial hierarchy.

### Notes for Use
- Primary example of spatial definition through systematic value control
- Focus on how value progression creates atmospheric perspective
- Demonstrates integration of linear and atmospheric perspective for architectural space
- Shows how distinct spatial planes guide the eye through the composition
- **Critical Tool Requirements**: Pen + wash technique essential for combining linear precision with tonal variation
