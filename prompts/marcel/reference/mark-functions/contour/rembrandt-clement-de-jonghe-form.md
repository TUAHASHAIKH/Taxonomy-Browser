### Line / Tone Concepts

**1. Hatching to Define Surface Contour**  
- **Keywords:** Rembrandt, hatching, cross-hatching, contour, surface, portrait, figure  

- **Analysis:** This portrait etching demonstrates the 'Rembrandt Principle' of using hatching to define and follow surface contours. Rather than building form structurally, Rembrandt's hatching traces the existing surfaces - curved hatching follows the rounded contour of the hat, directional hatching maps the surface planes of clothing folds. The hatching describes what is already there, following the natural contours and surface changes of the figure. The background's consistent parallel lines provide contrast, making the figure's varied surface-following hatching more prominent.  

- **Drawing Tip:**
**Form**: Hatching lines that follow the surface contours of forms rather than building structural mass can define curved surfaces.
**Function**: This emphasizes the planes and surface modeling of the subject through directional mark-making.  

**2. Surface Mapping Through Directional Marks**  
- **Keywords:** surface mapping, directional marks, contour definition, surface planes, descriptive hatching  

- **Analysis:** Rembrandt uses hatching as a mapping tool to describe surface topology. Each area of hatching corresponds to a specific surface plane or contour change. The marks don't create form so much as reveal it - they follow the natural geography of the subject's surfaces. Dense cross-hatching occurs where surfaces turn away from light, while lighter parallel hatching traces gentler surface changes. The hatching acts as a descriptive language that reads the subject's existing form.  

- **Drawing Tip:**
**Form**: Hatching as a mapping tool with varying density and direction corresponding to specific surface planes and contour changes can describe complex surface topology.
**Function**: This allows marks to follow what is observed rather than impose structure.

### Notes for Use
- Primary example of hatching used to define and follow surface contours
- Focus on how marks trace existing surface geography rather than building structure
- Demonstrates descriptive hatching that reads and maps surface topology
