### Line / Tone Concepts

**1. Shaping Form with Rhythmic Hatching**
- **Keywords:** rhythmic hatching, contour hatching, volume, form, repetition, pattern, structure

- **Analysis:** Notice how Manet uses rhythmic hatching to define tonal areas within bounded shapes. The diagonal marks on the jacket stay contained within the garment's form, the curved hatching on the guitar respects the instrument's contours, and the fine marks on the fingers remain within each digit's boundaries. Unlike atmospheric hatching that might blur across forms, these marks are disciplined—each shape maintains its own distinct tonal character through contained rhythmic patterns. This approach also creates textural contrast between the hatched areas, the white paper shapes that remain untouched, and the darker areas that are filled with crosshatching or solid blacks.

- **Drawing Tip:**
**Form**: Repeating, parallel marks that follow contours can build volume and rhythm simultaneously.
**Function**: This creates visual beats that enhance three-dimensional form through rhythmic mark-making.

### Notes for Use
- Primary example of using rhythmic hatching to build form and volume.
- Focus on how the parallel marks follow the contours of the subject's clothing and hair.
- Demonstrates the integration of texture (rhythm) and structure (form).
