### Line / Tone Concepts

**1. Hatching as Structure**
- **Keywords:** structural hatching, directional marks, form, mass, density, texture, substance

- **Analysis:** Notice how Van Gogh uses the inherent lights and darks of his hatching marks to create structural form. The dense, vertical hatching in the foreground creates both tonal variation and structural definition—the lights and darks organize into contours, mass, and physical trajectories, where the accumulated lights and darks create the structural presence of the foliage rather than just surface tone.

- **Drawing Tip:**
**Form**: Hatching lines that follow the structural trajectories of growth and form can build convincing three-dimensional mass.
**Function**: This creates volume through directional mark-making that reinforces natural structural patterns.

### Notes for Use
- Primary example of using hatching to build structure and form directly.
- Focus on how the vertical marks in the foreground create a structural plane.
- Demonstrates how dense, directional marks can constitute the substance of an object, like the foliage in the tree.
