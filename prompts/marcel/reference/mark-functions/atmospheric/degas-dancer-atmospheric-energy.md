### Line / Tone Concepts

**1. Hatching for Atmospheric Energy**  
- **Keywords:** atmospheric hatching, energy, movement, radiating lines, vitality, directional force, dynamic background  

- **Analysis:** Notice how the diagonal hatching lines radiate outward from the dancer, creating atmospheric energy that enhances the sense of movement. These aren't just tonal marks building shadow—they're directional forces that give the drawing a sense of life and motion. The hatching follows the gesture of the pose, with lines that seem to emanate from the figure's energy, making the background itself feel alive and responsive to the dancer's movement.  

- **Drawing Tip:**
**Form**: Directional hatching that radiates from the subject can create atmospheric energy around figures in motion.
**Function**: This enhances the sense of movement and dynamic vitality through environmental force lines.

### Notes for Use
- Primary example of hatching serving dual function: tone AND atmospheric energy
- Focus on how directional hatching enhances gesture and movement
- Demonstrates hatching as dynamic background that responds to the subject's energy
