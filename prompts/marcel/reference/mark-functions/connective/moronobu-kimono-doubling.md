### Line / Tone Concepts

**1. Connective Lines Through Doubling Forms**  
- **Keywords:** kimono flow, doubling shapes, water-like forms, mirrored contours, fabric connection, similar rhythms  

- **Analysis:** Notice how the kimono shapes of both women in the bottom right flow downward with nearly identical contours, creating a doubling effect that mimics the movement of water. The fabric forms mirror each other's curves and rhythms, establishing visual connection through similarity rather than direct contact. This doubling creates a sense of harmony and relationship between the subjects through shared formal language, where one woman's kimono shape echoes and reinforces the other's.  

- **Drawing Tip:**
**Form**: Repeating similar shapes or contours between separate elements can create visual unity.
**Function**: This establishes connection and formal echoing that unifies disparate parts of a composition.
