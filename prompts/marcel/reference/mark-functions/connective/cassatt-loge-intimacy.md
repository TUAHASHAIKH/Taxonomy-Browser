### Line / Tone Concepts

**1. Connective Lines for Creating Intimacy**  
- **Keywords:** connective lines, intimacy, circular motion, bundling, eye movement, relationships, unity  

- **Analysis:** Notice how Cassatt creates a visual circuit to unify the figures. The fan's arc initiates the movement, flowing toward the companion's shoulder. From there, the line continues down her arm and is picked up by the folds of fabric and gestural marks in their laps, creating a continuous circular path. This looping motion visually binds the two figures, enclosing them in a shared, intimate space.  

- **Drawing Tip:**
**Form**: Continuous visual circuits that flow between subjects through dominant shapes or contours extended through other forms—such as arms, shoulders, or clothing—can create intimacy.
**Function**: This guides the viewer's eye in a loop that physically connects the subjects, enclosing them in a single unit.

### Notes for Use
- Primary example of connective function creating emotional relationships between people
- Focus on the specific circular eye movement created by the fan's arc
- Demonstrates how lines can serve dual functions (form definition + connection)
