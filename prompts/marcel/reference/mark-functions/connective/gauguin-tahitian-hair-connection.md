### Line / Tone Concepts

**1. Connective Lines for Dynamic Eye Movement**  
- **Keywords:** hair connection, eye guidance, fluid movement, directional flow, visual pathway, dynamic composition  

- **Analysis:** Notice how the hair outline of the upper woman flows downward on the left side and seamlessly connects with the hairline of the profile woman below. This creates a continuous flowing line that guides your eye in a dynamic, fluid movement through the composition. Each face has a distinct identity - looking in different directions as if they are different people thinking about different things - yet the connecting hair forms create a visual pathway that moves your eye fluidly between them, establishing directional flow rather than static grouping.  

- **Drawing Tip:**
**Form**: Flowing, connecting lines that guide the viewer's eye in a continuous path around subjects can show relationships.
**Function**: This creates visual intimacy and dynamic eye movement between figures. If you want to create a dynamic visual flow between separate dipictions on a single page, intentionally merge the contour of one key object into another. For example, let the outline of a shoulder flow directly into the jawline of a face below it. This technique unifies disparate elements into a single, fluid unit.

### Notes for Use
- Primary example of connective function creating directional eye movement
- Focus on the specific hair connection on the left side between upper and profile figures
- Demonstrates dynamic fluid pathways that guide viewer's eye through composition
- Shows distinct identities (different people looking in different directions) connected by visual flow
