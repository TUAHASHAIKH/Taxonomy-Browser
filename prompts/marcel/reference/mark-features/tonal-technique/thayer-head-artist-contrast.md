### Line / Tone Concepts

**1. Intense Darks Hatching Within Blending**
- **Keywords:** intense darks, hatching, blending, darkest darks, maximum darkness, cross-hatching
- **Analysis:** Notice how Thayer uses intense darks hatching and cross-hatching to push into the darkest darks and achieve maximum tonal range. The hatching works within areas of blending to create the deepest shadows and most intense darkness possible. This technique allows for expanded tonal range that goes beyond what blending alone can achieve. The interplay between the smooth blended passages and the intense hatching marks creates textural contrast, but the primary purpose is achieving the darkest possible values.
- **Drawing Tip:** If you want to achieve the darkest darks in your drawings, you can use intense darks hatching with soft lead and high pressure cross-hatching. This technique pushes your tonal range to its maximum, creating the deepest possible shadows that go beyond what blending alone can achieve.

### Notes for Use
- Primary example of using energetic hatching to create dramatic high contrast planes.
- Focus on how the dense marks on the left side create a powerful contrast with lighter areas.
- Demonstrates building form through accumulated tonal weight within a gradient continuum.
