### Line / Tone Concepts

**1. Foreground Emphasis Through Line Weight Hierarchy**  
- **Keywords:** spatial hierarchy, foreground emphasis, progressive line weight, atmospheric perspective, depth creation, shadow indication  

- **Analysis:** Notice how Bazicaluva uses heavy, confident pen lines for the closest rocks and trees in the foreground, then progressively lighter lines as forms recede into the distance. The line weight creates a clear spatial hierarchy that guides your eye through the composition from front to back. Additionally, the line weight doubles as shadow indication - thicker lines appear at shadowed edges where forms turn away from light, while lighter lines define surfaces that catch illumination.  

- **Drawing Tip:**
**Form**: Progressively heavier line weights for foreground elements, with confident pen strokes that anchor closest forms, can create spatial depth.
**Function**: This achieves atmospheric perspective that guides the eye from front to back.

### Notes for Use
- Primary example of line weight creating spatial hierarchy and depth
- Focus on the progressive weight reduction from foreground to background
- Demonstrates line weight serving dual function: spatial depth AND shadow indication
- Shows how confident, heavy strokes anchor foreground elements
