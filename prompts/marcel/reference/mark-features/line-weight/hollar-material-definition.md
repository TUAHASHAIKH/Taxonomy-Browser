### Line / Tone Concepts

**1. Material Definition Through Line Quality and Character**  
- **Keywords:** material definition, line direction, line rhythm, texture indication, surface character, directional hatching, radiating lines, parallel lines  
- **Analysis:** Notice how Hollar varies the quality and character of his lines - not just their weight - to define different materials. The directional hatching lines follow the form and texture of each surface: flowing parallel lines for the smooth fabric of the kerchief, radiating curved lines that follow the fur's natural growth pattern on the muff, and precise controlled lines for the structured mask. Each material reads distinctly because the line direction and rhythm changes to match the surface character, creating tactile differentiation through mark-making technique.  
- **Drawing Tip:** **Form**: Varying line direction and rhythm - flowing parallel lines for smooth fabrics, radiating curved lines for fur, and precise controlled lines for structured surfaces - can define different materials. **Function**: This creates tactile differentiation through mark-making technique.

### Notes for Use
- Primary example of line quality (not just weight) creating material definition
- Focus on how line character changes to match surface texture
- Demonstrates tactile differentiation through varied mark-making techniques
- Shows how line quality can be as important as line weight for material indication
