### Line / Tone Concepts
**1. Visual Grouping & Unit Boundaries Through Line Weight**  
- **Keywords:** visual grouping, unit boundaries, heavy contour, shadow grounding, mass definition, oppressive weight, grouped objects  
- **Analysis:** Notice how Daumier uses heavy contour lines around the grouped money sacks (labeled "1,000,000") to define them as a single oppressive mass. The line weight shifts strategically where shadows fall, grounding the forms and emphasizing their crushing weight on the figure below. The heavy outline treatment makes the sacks read as one unified burden rather than individual objects, reinforcing the political metaphor of France's war reparations after the Franco-Prussian War.  
- **Drawing Tip:** **Form**: Heavy contour lines around grouped objects, with strategic line weight shifts where shadows fall, can group related elements. **Function**: This creates single visual units and emphasizes their physical presence and weight.

### Notes for Use
- Primary example of line weight creating visual grouping and unit boundaries
- Focus on how heavy contours unify multiple objects into single mass
- Demonstrates line weight serving dual function: grouping AND emphasis of weight/pressure
- Shows how technical choices can reinforce metaphorical content
