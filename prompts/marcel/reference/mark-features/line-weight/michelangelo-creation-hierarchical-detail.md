### Line / Tone Concepts

**1. Hierarchical Detail Through Line Weight Variation**  
- **Keywords:** hierarchical detail, anatomical emphasis, line weight variation, preparatory studies, muscular definition, structural importance  
- **Analysis:** Notice how Michelangelo uses varying line weights to establish a hierarchy of anatomical importance across the figure studies. The primary contours defining major muscle groups and structural elements like shoulders, torso, and limbs receive bold, confident strokes, while secondary details such as surface modeling and minor anatomical features are rendered with lighter, more delicate lines. This weight variation guides the viewer's eye to the most structurally significant aspects of the human form first, then allows exploration of subtler details, creating a clear reading order that reflects both artistic priority and anatomical understanding.  
- **Drawing Tip:** **Form**: Bold, confident lines for primary structural elements and major muscle groups, with lighter lines for secondary details and surface modeling, can establish visual hierarchy. **Function**: This creates clear reading priorities in figure studies based on anatomical importance.

### Notes for Use
- Primary example of line weight creating hierarchical emphasis in anatomical studies
- Focus on how weight variation guides the eye through structural importance
- Demonstrates preparatory drawing techniques for major compositions
- Shows how line weight can reflect both artistic intention and anatomical knowledge
