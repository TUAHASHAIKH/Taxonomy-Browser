### Line / Tone Concepts

**1. Sculptural Line Weight**  
- **Keywords:** sculptural line weight, contour breathing, shadow areas, light edges, 3D illusion, pressure variation  
- **Analysis:** The contour line 'breathes' - thicker in shadow areas (under chin, elbow crook), thinner on light-catching edges. Creates 3D illusion with line alone through controlled pressure variation that follows the form's relationship to light.  
- **Drawing Tip:** **Form**: Vary pencil pressure - harder for shadows, lighter for edges in light. **Function**: This creates sculptural volume through line weight alone, making flat contours appear three-dimensional.  

**2. Contrast of Line and Tone**  
- **Keywords:** line tone contrast, crisp contours, soft blending, focal emphasis, material differentiation  
- **Analysis:** Clothing defined by crisp contour lines, face rendered with soft blended tones. This contrast draws focus to the serene expression while differentiating between the precise structure of fabric and the soft modeling of flesh.  
- **Drawing Tip:** **Form**: Use crisp contour lines for structured elements, soft blended tones for organic forms. **Function**: This contrast creates focal hierarchy and material differentiation.  

**3. Pattern Following Form**  
- **Keywords:** pattern following form, checked dress pattern, cross-contour technique, fabric folds, 3D body form  
- **Analysis:** Checked dress pattern curves to follow 3D body form and fabric folds - sophisticated cross-contour technique that shows how surface patterns must respect underlying three-dimensional structure.  
- **Drawing Tip:** **Form**: Let surface patterns curve and distort to follow the underlying form. **Function**: This maintains structural believability while adding surface detail.

### Notes for Use
- Primary example of sculptural line weight creating three-dimensional illusion
- Focus on how line pressure variation follows light and shadow patterns
- Demonstrates sophisticated integration of pattern with underlying form structure
