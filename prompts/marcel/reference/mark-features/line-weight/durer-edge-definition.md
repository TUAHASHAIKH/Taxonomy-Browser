### Line / Tone Concepts

**1. Edge Definition Through Line Weight Hierarchy**  
- **Keywords:** edge definition, silhouette emphasis, figure-ground separation, interior modeling, shadow-side weighting, spatial clarity, chiaroscuro effect  
- **Analysis:** Notice how Dürer uses the heaviest lines at the silhouettes where the figures meet the background, creating clear figure-ground separation. This edge contrast makes the figures appear to come forward from the picture plane, often enhanced by dark backgrounds that create a chiaroscuro effect where the heavy silhouettes represent forms catching light as they emerge from darkness. Medium weight lines define where forms meet within the figures themselves - such as where Adam's arm crosses his torso. The lightest lines are reserved for interior modeling and surface details. Heavy strokes consistently appear on the shadow side of forms, adding both spatial and lighting clarity to enhance the three-dimensional illusion.  
- **Drawing Tip:** **Form**: Heaviest lines for silhouettes, medium weight where forms meet within subjects, and lightest lines for interior surface modeling can create clear spatial relationships. **Function**: This achieves edge contrast that brings forms forward from the background.

### Notes for Use
- Primary example of line weight creating edge definition and spatial clarity
- Focus on the systematic hierarchy: silhouette > internal boundaries > surface modeling
- Demonstrates how heavy strokes on shadow side enhance both form and lighting
- Shows precise control of line weight to separate figure from ground
