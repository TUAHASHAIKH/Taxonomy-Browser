### Line / Tone Concepts

**1. Psychological Line Quality Through Edge Character**  
- **Keywords:** line character, edge quality, psychological atmosphere, nervous lines, broken contours, angular distortion, confidence variation, expressive boundaries  

- **Analysis:** Schiele demonstrates how the character of line boundaries creates psychological atmosphere through varied edge qualities. Notice the contrast between sharp, angular lines that create tension and anxiety, and softer, more hesitant marks that suggest vulnerability. His lines are often broken and interrupted, creating a nervous, searching quality that builds psychological intensity. Some contours are bold and decisive while others appear hesitant and fragmented. The angular, geometric simplification of organic forms creates an expressive distortion that prioritizes emotional resonance over naturalistic representation. The line quality itself becomes the primary expressive content - jagged edges create agitation, broken lines suggest introspection, and the overall character of boundaries shapes the psychological atmosphere of the portrait.  

- **Drawing Tip:**
**Form**: Vary your line character deliberately - use sharp, angular edges for psychological tension, broken or interrupted lines for introspective moments, and contrast confident strokes with hesitant marks.
**Function**: This creates psychological atmosphere through the fundamental character of your mark boundaries, making the quality of edges as expressive as the forms they define.
