# Tone & Value Theory - Brainstorming Notes

## Key Concepts to Explore

### Spatial Relationships Through Value
- **Darks Coming Forward**: How dark values can advance in space rather than recede
- **Example**: [The Omval - AIC](https://www.artic.edu/artworks/75520/the-omval)
  - Note: Study how dark areas create spatial advancement

### Value Structure Fundamentals
- Light source and shadow patterns
- Form modeling through value gradation
- Value hierarchy and organization
- Contrast as compositional tool

### Atmospheric Effects
- Atmospheric perspective through value
- Distance and clarity relationships
- Environmental lighting effects

### Value vs. Mark Relationship
- How tonal technique (marks) serves value structure (concept)
- Integration with existing mark taxonomy
- When to prioritize value over line

## Research Links & References

### Museum Examples
- [The Omval - Rembrandt - AIC](https://www.artic.edu/artworks/75520/the-omval) - Dark values advancing spatially
- [Harvest Talk - Charles White - AIC](https://www.artic.edu/artworks/111810/harvest-talk) - Tone as volume

### Additional Sources to Investigate
- *Add more examples as discovered*

## Notes & Observations

- Current system focuses heavily on mark-making techniques
- Missing broader value theory and spatial relationships
- Need to bridge gap between technique and concept
- Consider how this integrates with existing artist methods

## Development Areas

1. **Value Hierarchy Theory**
2. **Light Logic Principles** 
3. **Spatial Value Relationships**
4. **Integration with Mark Taxonomy**
